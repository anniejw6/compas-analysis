Partial Re-Analysis of ProPublica's Analysis
=============

This repo contains my (partial) re-analysis of the ProPublica story "Machine Bias."

The only part changed from the original is [`regression-correction.ipynb`](https://github.com/anniejw6/compas-analysis/blob/master/regression-correction.ipynb).

Story:
https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing/

Methodology:
https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm/

Notebook (you'll probably want to follow along in the methodology):
https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis/blob/master/Compas%20Analysis.ipynb

Main Dataset:
compas.db - a sqlite3 database containing criminal history, jail and prison time, demographics and COMPAS risk scores for defendants from Broward County.

Other files as needed for the analysis.
